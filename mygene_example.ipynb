These kinases mediate cellular responses to stresses such as DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. This kinase is a component of two distinct complexes, mTORC1, which controls protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, and mTORC2, which is a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, and promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression. This protein acts as the target for the cell-cycle arrest and immunosuppressive effects of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Inhibitors of mTOR are used in organ transplants as immunosuppressants, and are being evaluated for their therapeutic potential in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome and somatic focal cortical dysplasia type II. The ANGPTL7 gene is located in an intron of this gene.

       "  'summary': 'The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases. These kinases mediate cellular responses to stresses such as DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. This kinase is a component of two distinct complexes, mTORC1, which controls protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, and mTORC2, which is a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, and promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression. This protein acts as the target for the cell-cycle arrest and immunosuppressive effects of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Inhibitors of mTOR are used in organ transplants as immunosuppressants, and are being evaluated for their therapeutic potential in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome and somatic focal cortical dysplasia type II. The ANGPTL7 gene is located in an intron of this gene.

The other components of this complex are beta-prime-adaptin, gamma-adaptin, and the small chain AP1S1. This complex is located at the Golgi vesicle and links clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles. These vesicles are involved in endocytosis and Golgi processing. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct protein isoforms have been found for this gene.
